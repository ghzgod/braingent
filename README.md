# Braingent

![Braingent Screenshot](Screenshot.png)

A neural network simulation that models how different regions of the human brain process information. Braingent routes user queries to relevant brain regions, simulates internal processing, and provides responses that mimic human cognitive processes.

## Features

- **Brain Region Simulation**: Simulates 15 different brain regions including Prefrontal Cortex, Amygdala, Hippocampus, and more
- **Visual Brain Model**: Interactive visualization showing which regions are active during processing
- **Real-time Processing**: Watch as thoughts are processed through different regions of the simulated brain
- **Internal Monologue**: Option to view the internal "thoughts" of each brain region
- **Fast Thinking Mode**: Accelerated processing for quicker responses
- **Customizable Ollama Integration**: Connect to your own Ollama instance with model selection
